### 'Ello.

- Iâ€™m not mainly working on personal projects right now.
- Archived repos are for personal projects that are not done and have no plan to resume.
- You can contact me by [Mail](mailto:ruby3141@gmail.com) \
  But if you want to ask about personal project I made before, please use Issue tab first.

<sub>For the word "DevRIS"(or "Devris" for CamelCase), last 's' is silent like "debris".</sub>
